<h1>Traffic Light Simulation </h1><br>
Simulating a Traffic Light Cycle Using C Programming <br>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<ul>
  

<li><p>Using a straightforward loop and state transitions. </p></li>
<li> sleep() function to control the duration of each light state.</li>
<li>ANSI color code for better visualization</li>
 By implementing this approach, the program effectively models a basic traffic light system using simple programming constructs.
